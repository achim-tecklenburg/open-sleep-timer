## What is it?

This is a Clone of [Sweet Dreams](http://www.svenbader.de/downloads_software_sweet_dreams/) for Windows.
It slowly fades out System Master Volume to help you fall asleep.

## Download

-> [Dowload Exe für Windows](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mdfv44qlsc0xy1z/opensleeptimer-latest.zip?dl=0)

Now it works only on Windows, but versions für Mac & Linux are planned.

## Features
The only Feature at the moment is, that it turns down Master Volume over a configurable amount of time, then stops.
For planned Features there is a Roadmap on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/shS1Qphz/open-sleep-timer).

## Code
It is written in FreePascal using [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus-ide.org/) - the open Source Delphi Clone.
